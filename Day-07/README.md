# Project on VPC with Public - Private Subnet in Production 

## Services used - VPC, EC2, Automatic Scaling Group, Launch Templates, Security Group, Linux, Load Balancer.

## Description

####  - This project demonstrates how to create a VPC that can be used for server in a production environment 
####  - To improve resiliency, Deployed the server in two availability Zones, by using an Auto Scaling group and an Application Load Balancer. 
#### - For additional security, deployed the server in private subnet. 
####  - The servers receive request through the load balancer. The server can connect o the internet by using a NAT gateway. To improve resiliency, deployed the gateway in both Availability Zones.

## Overview

#### - The VPC has public subnets and private subnets in two Availability Zones.
#### - Each public subnet contains a NAT gateway and a load balancer node.
#### - The servers run in the private subnets, are launched and terminated by using an Auto Scaling group, and receive traffic from the Load Balancer.
#### - The servers can connect to the internet by using the NAT gateway.

## Lets start with creating a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud).
### Required Configuration for VPC 
-	Select option - VPC and more 
-	Name the VPC 
-	Number of Availability Zones - 2 (for High Availability)
-	Number of Public Subnet - 2
-	Number of Private Subnet - 2
-	Number of NAT Gate - 1 per AZ (For masking of application IP addresses)
-	VPC  endpoints  -  None (As Database is not required – 2 Tier Application)

-	Search for EC2 
-	Search for Auto Scaling Group
-	Click on Create Launch Template

## Now  check EC2 instance if Auto Scaling Group have created 2  instances in the selected subnet at step 2 of Auto Scaling Group Creation
After checking the subnets, we will install the applications  in both the private instances 
## Bastion Host
For installing applications, we need to connect the private application server. To connect the private server, we need to create Bastion Host ( As public IP is not present to SSH the private application server ) 
For creating Bastion Host, we will Create an EC2 instance 
-	Name instance Bastion Host
-	Select the image ubuntu (For Linux based applications )

-	Instance type – t2 micro
-	Select Key pair to ssh connect the Bastion Host

-	Network setting - select the same VPC as created above 
-	Add security group which allow SSH connect to Bastion Host 
-	Enable assign public IP
-	Hit Launch Instance

## Copy the key pair (pem file) from local computer to the bastion server using the SCP command
-	scp -i /path/key-pair-name.pem /home/ubuntu/key.pem ubuntu@IP ADDRESH:/home/ubuntu

## Connect to the Bastion Host through ubuntu terminal using SSH command 
-	ssh -i /path/key-pair-name.pem instance-user-name@instance-public-ip-address

After establishing the connection with Bastion Host, we will connect to the private application server  
Check if the pem file is present or not by using ( ls )command

 ## Install the application 
-	Make a simple vim file  ( vim index.html )and  write this simple html code 
<! DOCTYPE html>
